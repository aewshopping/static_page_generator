# static_page_generator
Creates a big webpage from a bunch of text files

This is a minimum viable thing with everything in one html file.

It includes:

- upload text files to the page
- load content of text files to the page
- each file content seperated by a horizontal rule
- parsed by a super barebones markdown processor
- with a smattering of css
